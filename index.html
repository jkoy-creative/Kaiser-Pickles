            <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                Kaiser Pickles is part of the family owned Kaiser Foods group of companies. Kaiser Pickles was started in 1920 in Cincinnati Ohio by Harry T. Kaiser Sr. It started out as a food stand operating at various city markets. In 1930, Harry changed the company to a food distributor servicing the Greater Cincinnati area. The product line consisted of pickles, kraut and relishes.

            <br>
                Upon completing his time in the Army, Harry T. Kaiser Jr. joined his father in 1955 and eventually took over the business in 1967. Harry Jr. (Ted) added various other product lines and took the distribution from two to five weekly routes. In 1986 his son David came on board and the two of them started transforming the company into what it is today.

                In 1990 they opened their first pickle processing facility producing approximately 18,000 bushels of pickles. The company secured the majority of its cucumbers from local farms in the state of Michigan. In 1998 Harry Jr. retired and turned the business over to David, his siblings and extended family members. The company with the purchase of the Matthews Pickle Company in 2010 became a fully integrated pickle company. The company added the production of peppers in 2012.
